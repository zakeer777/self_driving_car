# self driving car
This repository contains the code for a self-driving car project using machine learning. The project is built using Python and utilizes TensorFlow for training and implementing the machine learning models. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled images and sensor data to make predictions on steering angles and control the car's movements. The project also includes code for integrating the model with the car's hardware and software systems to enable autonomous driving. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it a great resource for anyone interested in learning about self-driving cars and machine learning. Feel free to use the code for your own projects and experiments. 

refer the repository for code and dataset.

please submit any bug reports or pull requests to help improve the project.
